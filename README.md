# Professor Carl üéì

**A Socratic English tutor powered by Claude and Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

Professor Carl is an AI teaching assistant designed for classroom office hours. Unlike traditional AI that gives direct answers, Carl uses the **Socratic method** to guide students toward understanding through thoughtful questions and tiered hints.

## ‚ú® Features

**Phase 1 (Current) - Working MVP:**
- ‚úÖ **Socratic Pedagogy** - Enforces "guide, don't give" teaching

- ‚úÖ **Academic Integrity** - Built-in protections against misuse
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting** - Protection against spam and API cost overruns
- ‚úÖ **Test Suite** - 22 passing tests validating pedagogy

**Phase 2 (Planned):**
- üöß Hint stepper UI with tiered reveals
- üöß Sub-agents for specific tasks (/thesis, /outline, /cite, /revise)
- üöß Tools sidebar showing MCP resources
- üöß Additional MCP servers (SQLite, custom)

**Phase 3 (Future):**
- üìã Student session management
- üìã Classroom analytics dashboard
- üìã HTTP MCP servers (when available)
- üìã Advanced testing with Playwright

## üéØ How It Works

### The Socratic Method in Action

**Traditional AI:**
> Student: "What should my thesis be?"
> AI: "Your thesis should be: In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses..."

**Professor Carl:**
> Student: "What should my thesis be?"
> Carl: "Let's think about this together. What's the main argument you want to make about the text? What would someone disagree with?"

### Pedagogical Rules (Enforced by Middleware)

Carl follows these principles programmatically:

1. **No spoilers before attempts** - Student must try first
2. **Tiered hints** - Conceptual ‚Üí Structural ‚Üí Example
3. **Metacognitive checks** - "Why?" and "How do you know?"
4. **Process over product** - Guide drafting, not deliver final work
5. **Academic integrity** - No verbatim graded work

These aren't just guidelines - they're **validated in code** and **tested automatically**.

## üìö For Students

### Good Uses of Professor Carl ‚úÖ

- **Brainstorming**: "I'm writing about symbolism. What should I consider?"
- **Getting unstuck**: "I'm stuck on my thesis. Can you help me refine it?"
- **Understanding concepts**: "What's the difference between theme and motif?"
- **Revision help**: "Here's my draft. What could be stronger?"

### Misuse ‚ùå

- Asking Carl to write your essay
- Copying output directly into assignments
- Trying to get answers without attempting
- Using Carl to avoid learning

**Remember**: Carl is a tutor, not a ghostwriter. The work you submit must be your own.

### Rate Limits ‚è±Ô∏è

During testing, Professor Carl has limits to protect against unexpected costs:
- **20 messages per 15 minutes** (per student)
- **200 messages per hour** (everyone combined)

If you hit the limit, Carl will tell you exactly how long to wait before the limit resets. The app isn't broken - it's just protecting the system while we're testing!

See [docs/RATE_LIMITS.md](./docs/RATE_LIMITS.md) for details.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Instructors

### Deployment

See [docs/DEPLOY.md](./docs/DEPLOY.md) for:
- Local development setup
- Vercel deployment (recommended)
- Docker deployment
- MCP server configuration
- Cost estimates (~$0.05-0.15 per session)

### Safety & Privacy

See [docs/SAFETY.md](./docs/SAFETY.md) for:
- Academic integrity enforcement
- Data privacy (FERPA/GDPR)
- Prompt injection protection
- Content safety
- Incident response

### Customization

**Adjust teaching style** - Edit `/agent/prompts/socratic.md`:
- Change tone (formal/casual)
- Specialize for your subject
- Adjust hint aggressiveness

**Tune pedagogy rules** - Edit `/agent/rubrics/socratic.yml`:
- Minimum student attempts before hints
- Required metacognitive checks
- Forbidden actions

**Add course context** - Update MCP servers in `.mcp.json`:
- Point to your course materials folder
- Add reading lists
- Connect to Notion, Google Drive, etc.

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

**Current test coverage:**
- ‚úÖ 22/22 tests passing
- Core Socratic rules validated
- Integration scenarios tested
- Session state management verified

## üîß MCP Integration

Professor Carl uses Model Context Protocol to access:
- **Course materials** (filesystem MCP server)
- **Past sessions** (SQLite, optional)
- **External tools** (Notion, GitHub, etc. - coming in Phase 2)

Configure MCP servers in `.mcp.json` to give Carl access to your course resources.

See [docs/DEPLOY.md](./docs/DEPLOY.md) for detailed MCP setup.

## üéì Philosophy

> "The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein

Professor Carl believes that the best learning happens when students discover answers themselves, guided by thoughtful questions. This tool embodies that philosophy in every interaction.

**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for educators who believe in teaching students how to think, not what to think.**
